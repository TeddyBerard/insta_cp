# External Libraries:

I chose Kingfisher because it is a fast, and reliable Swift framework for loading images. It offers:
- A simple and easy-to-integrate API
- Built-in caching (memory + disk)
- Optimized performance and asynchronous loading
- Support for both UIKit and SwiftUI
- Advanced features like placeholders, retry logic, and image transformations
- Itâ€™s a solid choice that avoids reinventing the wheel while ensuring a great user experience.
